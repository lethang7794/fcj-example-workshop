With Hugo, you use front matter to add metadata to your content.

#### Example

```markdown
---
title: "Metadata for content file"
weight: 3
chapter: false
pre: " <b> 0.3 </b> "
---
```

#### Why use metadata do

You use metadata to:

- Describes the content

  e.g. The `title` is what showing in the navigation side bar.

- Controls the published structure of your site

  e.g. The `weight` is the used to sort the pages in a `page bundle` (a sub-directory in the `content` directory).
